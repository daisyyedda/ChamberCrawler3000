# ChamberCrawler3000+
# Introduction
The Game of ChamberCrawler3000+ (CC3k+) is a simplified rogue-like where the player character moves through a dungeon, slays enemies, and collects treasures until reaching the end of the dungeon (the end of the 5th floor). Each floor consists of 5 chambers connected with passages. In this simplified version of CC3K+, the display is going to be terminal-based, and the player needs to type in specific commands in which the command interpreter supplies to play the game. In addition, CC3k+ differs from other rogue-likes in a significant way: it only updates the terminal/window whenever a new command has been read in, rather than updating the display in a real-time manner.
